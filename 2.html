 <h2>Support란 무엇인가?</h2>
 <p>
  There are disadvantages of online support, however, including loss of confidentiality (as postings can be made public), questionable accuracy of information shared (one of the reasons many research participants have reported the wish to have professionally monitored internet support sites [Coulson and Shaw, 2013; Malik and Coulson, 2010; vanUden-Kraan et al., 2008]), lack of visual and aural cues found in traditional face-to-face communication, potentially poor technical quality, negative, sometimes hostile, social interactions due to the effects of social disinhibition that occur with anonymity, and a propensity to become addicted due to the constant and dynamic availability of the internet (Barak et al., 2008; Malik & Coulson, 2010). Nevertheless, the answer to the question in the title of this blog, is online support really supportive, appears to be yes. And, its availability is growing by leaps and bounds.
